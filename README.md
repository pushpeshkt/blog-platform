# blog-platform
this repository contains the source code for a full‑stack blog platform built with React on the front end and Appwrite as the back‑end service. The project demonstrates how to implement user authentication, CRUD operations for blog posts, image uploads and optional comments using Appwrite’s Auth, Databases, Storage and Functions services.
